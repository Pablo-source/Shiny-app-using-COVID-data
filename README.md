# Shiny-app-using-COVID-data

Basic bootstrap shiny app including leaflet maps, plots and dt tables

This is a basic Shiny app to practice how to create interactive visualizations in R. Using drop down filters to display information by countries and also adding  animations to show progress in time of covid19 cases around the world.

Data is refreshed daily from JHU Github repository and daily 10,000 population rates are calculated in two different R scripts that feed into the Shiny app displayed on the Shiny server. 

The Shiny app is structured into two sections: Maps and plots. Two tabs display grographical information in a leaflet map alllowing user to hover over countries to display tooltips on specific metircs for each country that change daily as the animation updates. 

I am using this app to test new Shiny, CSS and HTML features, I will build the app to include other technologies such as React and node.js. I intend to learn them to enhance the interactivity of this existing app.
