This folde will contain the R script to obtain population figures required to calculate the rates for COVID19 Indicators. 

File is called "ui_get_population_figures.R"

It uses WDI library to obtain WDI population figures

install.packages("WDI")
library(WDI)

## ui_get_population figures.R
# Get Total population by country indicator "SP.POP.TOTL"
getwd()

# LOAD population figures in the right way
WDIinputdata <- WDI(indicator=c("SP.POP.TOTL"),extra=TRUE)

**Finally these two main data sets are retained to populate the final Shiny app**

- POP_POPULATED
- PLOT_LEAFLET_CDR_NUM  (This is a specific data set including Lat and Long fields to draw Leaflet map)

  rm(list=ls()[!(ls()%in%c('POP_POPULATED','PLOT_LEAFLET_CDR_NUM'))])
