The data folder containes the downloaded compressed .csv files from John Hopkins repo 
- covid19JH.zip

Website for the John Hopkins data repo
https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19

The specific file to get latest Covid19 figures from is this github repo below: 
https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19

Once the compressed file is dowloaded into the data folder, we obtain three input files for the Shiny app:

- "time_series_covid19_confirmed_global.csv",
- "time_series_covid19_deaths_global.csv",
- "time_series_covid19_recovered_global.csv"

These three files are the COVID indicators: new, deaths and recovered cases that we will merge with population data to obtain specific population reates to compare values across countries.
